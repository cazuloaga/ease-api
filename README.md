To succesfully run on local:
- You must first install all dependencies using "yarn add".
- A mongoDB instance should be running with a database named "ease-api".
- A script has been configured to run local with "yarn dev"

To run tests a script has been configured to run with "yarn test"

You can also import postman collection with the "postman.collection.json" in directory.

Cheers!
